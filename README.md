# What is BMI?
BMI is used as a screening tool to indicate whether a person is underweight, overweight, obese or a healthy weight for their height.

If a person's BMI is out of the healthy BMI range, their health risks may increase significantly.The health risks associated with an increasing BMI are continuous, and the interpretation of BMI grading in relation to risk may differ for different populations

BMI values are age-independent and the same for both sexes. However, BMI may not correspond to the same degree of fatness in different populations due to different body proportions.
